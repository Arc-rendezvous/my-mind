**[TLDR]**
1. Coming up with original solution on ideation (brainstorming, divergent-thinking) tasks can be reached via two paths: **flexibility and persistence**. E.g. What should we do to improve our health?
2. Flexibility can be operationalized as the **number of content categories used**, and persistence can be established by **looking at within-category fluency**. E.g. Eat, Exercise, Sleep, etc. vs Do stretching during work, Take the stairs instead of elevators.
3. To generate on average more original ideas we need to think far (more flexible, more categories) and think deep (more persistent, more within category ideas). 
    * Think **far** when topic is **broad**
    * Think **deep** when topic is **narrow**
